# Coding project ideas

This is mainly for myself to help me remember my ideas (and also mark what I've already done), but you can look for an inspiration here! I might also add my solutions (mostly written in C#) to seprate branches in the future, so you can check them out for an inspiration (but be aware of my bad coding skills). If you have an idea for a good practice project, feel free to create a PR and I might add it. I'll try to group these ideas by difficulty, but it's probably not gonna be very accurate.
